# Hack a thing 2 -- Erika and Kristie
## Description 
Our website allows you to get a summary of all the important information about a movie using Wikipedia as its source. We used the package Beautiful Soup to help with the webscraping. 

## Who did what 

### Erika 
Followed webscraping tutorial 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI
attempted to use tutorial to webscrape amazon page, but realized the html tags were too complex for amazon with many layers, so switched to wikipedia 

Worked with Kristie to scrape necessary information from wikipedia pages 

### Kristie 



## What we learned 
Some webpages are much easier to webscrape than others.
