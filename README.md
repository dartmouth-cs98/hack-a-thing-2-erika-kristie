# Hack a thing 2 -- Erika and Kristie
## Description
Our website allows you to get a summary of all the important information about a movie using Wikipedia as the source. We used the package Beautiful Soup to help with the webscraping, a Python Flask Backend, and plain HTML/CSS.

## Who did what

### Erika
Followed webscraping tutorial
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQgXKtPSzUI
attempted to use tutorial to webscrape amazon page, but realized the html tags were too complex for amazon with many layers, so switched to wikipedia

Worked with Kristie to scrape necessary information from wikipedia pages using Python

### Kristie
Worked with Erica to scrape necessary information from wikipedia pages using Python.
Used the following tutorial (https://pythonhow.com/html-templates-in-flask/) to set up a basic Flask Backend and connect it with HTML/CSS templates. Retrieved assets from Google (credit: http://the-toast.net/2014/11/14/moogle-mom-search-engine/). Parsed the script we made together to dynamically update in our backend.


## What we learned
Some webpages are much easier to webscrape than others, how to build a Flask Backend and connect it with a frontend, more about HTML tags and styling,
